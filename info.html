	<h1>What is our current goal?</h1>
      <p style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;">The “Zeta Phi” Chapter of Kappa Alpha Order is raising money to benefit a veteran in need.

Steve was born and raised in High Point, NC. After high school he joined the US Army and became a Military Police Officer. His basic training was at Ft. McClellan, AL. From there he went to Ft. Hood, TX and was then sent to Stuttgart, Germany. Steve has been married for 32 years, has 2 children (Jennifer 30, Cody 25) and a new granddaughter. 

Steve was diagnosed with a variation of ALS, called PLS (Primary Lateral Sclerosis) in October of 2017 and was immediately advised to retire. Steve will never be able to walk on his own again. Please help us raise enough money to purchase an All Terrain Track Chair to give Steve his life back.
